## One stop destination for students.

Modules included:
  - Dictionary
  - Homework
  - Youtube
  - To-do
  - Notes
  - Book

I developed an online platform called Study Portal (Start Smart) that serves as a one-stop destination for students. The platform includes various modules such as notes, to-do list, dictionary, books, homework, YouTube, and Wikipedia. These modules provide students with a variety of resources to help them in their studies.

To develop the platform, I used a combination of technologies including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python (Django), GoogleAPI, DictionaryAPI, and DB SQLite. The platform is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it a valuable resource for students of all levels. Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me and helped me hone my skills in web development and programming.
